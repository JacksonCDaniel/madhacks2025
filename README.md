CodeCoach is a fully voice-driven mock technical interviewer that you can literally talk to. Instead of typing responses or reading text prompts, users simply speak naturally, and CodeCoach listens, understands, and responds out loud, just like a real human interviewer.

When a user selects what type of LeetCode problem they want to practice, CodeCoach generates an appropriate question and conducts the entire interview through two-way spoken conversation. It feels like a real interview, except less scary and available 24/7.

Some key features are
- Real-time speech-to-text using FishAudio
- Dynamic, AI-generated interviewer dialogue with selectable voices
- Integrated coding IDE 
- Interview state machine to simulate realistic interview flow
- Live chatlog panel with timestamps and message types
